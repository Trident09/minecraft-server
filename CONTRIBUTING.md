# Contributing to the Minecraft Server Repository

Welcome to the Minecraft server repository! This guide will help you understand how to contribute and maintain the server world files effectively.

## General Guidelines

1. **Respect the EULA**: Ensure that all modifications and contributions comply with Mojang's End User License Agreement (EULA). For more details, visit [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula).

2. **Keep It Fair**: Adhere to the rules of fair play and avoid introducing any pay-to-win elements or unauthorized modifications.

## Contributing World Files

### Pull Requests

If you are currently hosting the server, you are responsible for updating the repository with the latest world files. To do this:

1. **Update the World**: Make sure your local server's world is up-to-date and ready to be pushed to the repository.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request with the updated world files. Ensure that the following guidelines are met:
   - Only the `world` folder should be included in the pull request.
   - No other files or folders in the repository should be modified or included in the pull request.

3. **Description**: Provide a clear description of the changes made to the world in the pull request. This helps other contributors understand what has been updated.

### Directory Structure

- **Allowed Changes**: Only the `world` folder is permitted for modifications.
- **Restricted Areas**: Do not modify or add files outside the `world` folder. This includes, but is not limited to, configuration files, scripts, or documentation.

## Minecraft Community Standards

1. **Positive Interaction**: Maintain a friendly and supportive attitude towards other players and contributors. Avoid any behavior that could be considered harassment or trolling.

2. **No Exploits**: Do not introduce or exploit any bugs or cheats that give unfair advantages.

3. **Compliance with Server Rules**: Follow all server rules and guidelines as set by the current server hosts. This includes respecting the game’s rules and ensuring a good gaming experience for everyone.
